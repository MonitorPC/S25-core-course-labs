# Python web application details

This document describes the python web application developed to display the current time in moscow.

## Framework choice: flask

Flask was chosen for this project due to its simplicity, lightweight nature, and ease of use. it's well-suited for smaller projects like this, where a full-fledged framework like django might be overkill.  Flask's minimal setup allows for rapid development and deployment.

## Best practices applied:

* **Clear code structure:** the code is organized logically, with a single route handling the time display.
* **Use of timezone library (pytz):** `pytz` is used to ensure accurate time representation for moscow, handling daylight saving time correctly.  Avoiding naive datetime objects prevents potential errors.
* **String formatting:**  `strftime` is used for clear and customizable time formatting.
* **Keep it simple:**  the application focuses on a single, well-defined task.

## Coding standards and quality:

* **Pep 8 compliance:** the code follows pep 8 guidelines for readability, including consistent indentation, naming conventions, and line length.
* **Meaningful variable names:**  descriptive variable names like `moscow_tz` and `current_time` enhance code understanding.

# Unit Tests for Flask Application

## Description
The unit tests ensure that the Flask application is functioning correctly by verifying the root route (`/`) response. The test suite checks the status code and response content to confirm the expected output.

## Implemented Unit Tests
### 1. `test_moscow_time_route`
- **Purpose:** Validates that the root route (`/`) returns a successful response (`200 OK`).
- **Checks:**
  - The response status code is `200`.
  - The response body contains the expected text: `'The current time in Moscow is:'`.

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Use of `setUp` Method**
   - Initializes the test client before running tests to ensure an isolated environment.

2. **Status Code Verification**
   - Ensures that the route is accessible and functional.

3. **Content Validation**
   - Confirms that the response contains the expected output, reducing the risk of incorrect functionality.

4. **Use of `unittest.TestCase`**
   - Follows Pythonâ€™s built-in testing framework for consistency and ease of integration.

5. **Automated Testing**
   - The tests can be run automatically using `python -m unittest test_app.py` to verify application stability before deployment.

These best practices improve the reliability and maintainability of the application while ensuring that core functionalities work as expected.
