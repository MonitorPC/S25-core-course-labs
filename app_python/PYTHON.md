# python web application details

this document describes the python web application developed to display the current time in moscow.

## framework choice: flask

flask was chosen for this project due to its simplicity, lightweight nature, and ease of use. it's well-suited for smaller projects like this, where a full-fledged framework like django might be overkill.  flask's minimal setup allows for rapid development and deployment.

## best practices applied:

* **clear code structure:** the code is organized logically, with a single route handling the time display.
* **use of timezone library (pytz):** `pytz` is used to ensure accurate time representation for moscow, handling daylight saving time correctly.  avoiding naive datetime objects prevents potential errors.
* **string formatting:**  `strftime` is used for clear and customizable time formatting.
* **keep it simple:**  the application focuses on a single, well-defined task.

## coding standards and quality:

* **pep 8 compliance:** the code follows pep 8 guidelines for readability, including consistent indentation, naming conventions, and line length.
* **meaningful variable names:**  descriptive variable names like `moscow_tz` and `current_time` enhance code understanding.
* **comments:**  while the code is relatively self-explanatory, comments could be added for further clarification if needed in a larger application.

## testing:

the application can be tested by running it locally and refreshing the browser.  the displayed time should update with each refresh, indicating that the dynamic time retrieval is functioning correctly.  more formal testing could be implemented with a testing framework like `pytest` for larger applications, by mocking the `datetime.now()` function to ensure specific times are handled correctly.
