# Python web application details

This document describes the python web application developed to display the current time in moscow.

## Framework choice: flask

Flask was chosen for this project due to its simplicity, lightweight nature, and ease of use. it's well-suited for smaller projects like this, where a full-fledged framework like django might be overkill.  Flask's minimal setup allows for rapid development and deployment.

## Best practices applied:

* **Clear code structure:** the code is organized logically, with a single route handling the time display.
* **Use of timezone library (pytz):** `pytz` is used to ensure accurate time representation for moscow, handling daylight saving time correctly.  Avoiding naive datetime objects prevents potential errors.
* **String formatting:**  `strftime` is used for clear and customizable time formatting.
* **Keep it simple:**  the application focuses on a single, well-defined task.

## Coding standards and quality:

* **Pep 8 compliance:** the code follows pep 8 guidelines for readability, including consistent indentation, naming conventions, and line length.
* **Meaningful variable names:**  descriptive variable names like `moscow_tz` and `current_time` enhance code understanding.
